- very easy to get up and running, syntax and semantics pretty familiar
- prefer ruby style over python style but no biggie -- mixing function vs method style interesting, bit odd, seems like more typing than should be necessary
- discard is nice
- string ranges nice
- have to declare proc before used a bit annoying
- object hierarchy/inheritance still a bit confusing
- hashes - pretty good, no nils
- string is non-nullable - is there consistency here with what is nullable and what isn't?
