- reflection? e.g. type, object methods
- any casting at all?
- truthiness and falsiness
- operator precedence 

## Lox is a pretty tiny language. What features do you think it is missing that would make it annoying to use for real programs? (Aside from the standard library, of course.)

- arrays, objects
- anything to support concurrency
- try/catch
-
